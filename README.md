# Gauge Monte Carlo

This is a proof-of-concept implementation of a 1D canonical Monte Carlo simulation with phase space shifting as described in:

## Instructions

A recent version of [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) needs to be installed on your system.
Launch the Julia interpreter within this directory and type `]` to enter the package manager.
Activate the environment and install the required packages as follows:

```julia
activate .
instantiate
```

Type backspace to exit the package manager.
Run the main program:

```julia
include("main.jl")
```

The program performs Monte Carlo simulations with and without phase space shifting and plots the results, which will take a few minutes.
